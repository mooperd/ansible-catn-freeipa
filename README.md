DESCRIPTION:
------------
This playbook installs a FreeIPA Server in a node. 
All the vars to edit are in /group_vars/all.yml

HOW TO USE:
-----------
Edit /group_vars/all.yml with your desired configuration. 
Edit /hosts with THE SAME ip address than the previous configuration file. 


TO DO:
------------
"Be sure to back up the CA certificate stored in /root/cacert.p12 This file is required to create replicas. The password for this file is the Directory Manager password"

ASSUMPTIONS:
------------
-Network layer properly configured (eth0).
-Kerberos server installed and configured. 
-Other layers firewalls configured to allow al least HTTP/S, DNS, NTP,  Kerberos, LDAP/S and DOGTAG.
-Ssh connection to hosts. 

=======

CURRENT PROBLEM:
------------
-To skip a ca.cert problem I copied the cert to the client (based on this solution: https://fedorahosted.org/freeipa/ticket/3457 ). This problem will be fixed or the copy will be performed in the playbook. 
-It seems the problem is the DNS. But also could be another problem regarding to the previous problem. 
-I leave the client log to show what happens.
